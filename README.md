# ML-From-Scratch

Simple Machine Learning Implementation for different languages.

This is a repository for implementing Machine Learning Algorithms from scratch with minium library, and as a learning platform for my COMP2211 Course. The goal is to understand the algorithms and their implementation.

Contributions are welcome!
